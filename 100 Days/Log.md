# 100 Days of Code Challenge

### ✨ Day 1: April 25, 2022. MON
### Today's Progress: 
  * Grateful to have the opportunity of buying online courses on Udemy. I started watching and following along with The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! [JavaScript Course 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/lecture/22628657#overview). 
So far it's easy and I'm breezing through the vidoes. :)

  * I watched a coding challenge on YouTube that covers 10 JS Projects and replicated a Countdown Timer website. [Coding Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4&ab_channel=FlorinPop).

### Thoughts:
I really want to master JavaScript and create projects of my own using the said language. In order for that to happen, I need to practice coding daily, recreate different projects, and watch online tutorials.

  * I replicated a Quiz App website. [Coding Challenge](./https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4).

### Thoughts:
I just got familiar with ternary in JS 🥲, and it is quite a useful conditional operator. The Internet really is, above all else, a repository of knowledge - all the information is on there, it's all about how I use these opportunities that will truly make a difference.

### ✨ Day 3: April 27, 2022. WED

### Today's Progress:
  * I watched the next couple of videos on Udemy covering the JS functions.                                                                                               At the end of the tutorial, I had a coding challenge that allowed me to demonstrate what I learned and I'm thankful to have been able to finish the challenge.

### Thoughts: 
I had no idea what was the difference between a function expression and a function declaration. Maybe this is something I should have known by now, but I'm still happy I got to learn the difference today. I'll be moving on to JS arrays tomorrow and I hope I'm able to do the challenge as I struggle a little bit with the arrays. :(

### ✨ Day 4: April 28, 2022. THU

### Today's Progress:
 * I moved on to the arrays in my JS course. I had an array exercise awaiting me at the end which I was able to finish. Although, didn't make much progress with the videos as I would have liked, but tomorrow will definitely try to advance forward as I try to complete 2 coding challenges covering different topics.

### Thoughts: 
I'm getting the hang of the arrays; super practical and convenient - it is truly something that I want to master. I learned a couple of essential methods as well and tmrw I'll be introduced to objects in JavaScript.
