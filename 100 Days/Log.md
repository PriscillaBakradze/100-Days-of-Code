# 100 Days of Code Challenge

### ‚ú® Day 1: April 25, 2022. MON
### Today's Progress: 
  * Grateful to have the opportunity of buying online courses on Udemy. I started watching and following along with The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! [JavaScript Course 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/lecture/22628657#overview). 
So far it's easy and I'm breezing through the vidoes. :)

  * I watched a coding challenge on YouTube that covers 10 JS Projects and replicated a Countdown Timer website. [Coding Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4&ab_channel=FlorinPop).

### Thoughts:
I really want to master JavaScript and create projects of my own using the said language. In order for that to happen, I need to practice coding daily, recreate different projects, and watch online tutorials.

  * I replicated a Quiz App website. [Coding Challenge](./https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4).

### Thoughts:
I just got familiar with ternary in JS ü•≤, and it is quite a useful conditional operator. The Internet really is, above all else, a repository of knowledge - all the information is on there, it's all about how I use these opportunities that will truly make a difference.

### ‚ú® Day 3: April 27, 2022. WED

### Today's Progress:
I watched the next couple of videos on Udemy covering the JS functions. At the end of the tutorial, I had a coding challenge that allowed me to demonstrate what I learned and I'm thankful to have been able to finish the challenge.

### Thoughts: 
I had no idea what was the difference between a function expression and a function declaration. Maybe this is something I should have known by now, but I'm still happy I got to learn the difference today. I'll be moving on to JS arrays tomorrow and I hope I'm able to do the challenge as I struggle a little bit with the arrays. :(

### ‚ú® Day 4: April 28, 2022. THU

### Today's Progress:
I moved on to the arrays in my JS course. I had an array exercise awaiting me at the end which I was able to finish. Although, didn't make much progress with the videos as I would have liked, but tomorrow will definitely try to advance forward as I try to complete 2 coding challenges covering new topics.

### Thoughts: 
I'm getting the hang of the arrays; super practical and convenient - it is truly something that I want to master. I also learned a couple of essential methods.

### ‚ú® Day 5: April 29, 2022. FRI

### Today's Progress:
Continued with the arrays topic today and got into learning the objects, and for/while loops as well. With the help of the Lord, I was able to complete the 2 coding challenges at the end of the lesson and I also started a JS course on FreeCodeCamp and did couple of exercises on there.

### Thoughts:
Although am quite familiar as to how loops work, I'm grateful to have the opportunity to go over these concepts and refresh my mind cause I really am no expert and do need daily practice. And I feel like I should point this out...but the reason why I take a screenshot of my progress in my JS course on Udemy everyday is because on the 100th day of the challenge, I can look back and see the improvement and the progress that I have made... Hopefully by then I'll be more comfortable and confident with using JS functions, arrays, objects, loops, etc...

### ‚ú® Day 6: April 30, 2022. SAT

### Today's Progres:
I did FreeCodeCamp exercises today covering the objects in JS. Learned a difference between a dot notation and a bracket notation.

### Thoughts:
Took a little break from the Udemy courses as I'll be moving on to a different concept soon such as DOM fundamentals, and eventually start working on simple projects. Hence, I thought I'd do more exercises on FCC about objects/switch cases before I further move on to complex topics...As I am introduced to all these concepts though in JavaScript, it all still was a little fast paced during my classes so I wanna use my summer break to really grasp and learn all the "basics" in JS and go over everything that I might have missed or haven't paid attention to during my College studies...and I believe it's important to daily remind myself how blessed I am for all the opportunities and chances that I have...Thank the Lord!

### ‚ú® Day 7: May 1, 2022. SUN

### Today's Progress:
Continued practicing the objects and arrays on FreeCodeCamp. 

### Thoughts:
Learned the hasOwnProperty() method today which I hadn't heard before unfortunately...it essentially indicates whether the object owns the specified property as opposed to inheriting it...pretty straightfoward I know, lol :( Did some exercises on nested objects and arrays which was a little confusing at first, but I'm starting to fully understand and grasp the whole concept. Grateful for these short challenges that I get to do which help me to analyze and comprehend what exactly I learned... Today marks 1 week of the 100 DOC challenge, and I'm thankful to be apart of this as this challenge keeps me daily motivated and encouraged to keep on coding and studying!! Thanks *diliGentt*! <br/> (couldn't figure out how to accurately tag a person on GitHub, yes, I'm a boomer)....

### ‚ú® Day 8: May 2, 2022. MON

### Today's Progress:

### Thoughts:
Did an exercise at the end that covered the arrays topic...the challenge was a little confusing at first, but I understood the logic so it wasn't TOO bad...
I'm hoping that with more practice I'll be able to easily comprehend and solve problems, with the help of the Lord of course!

### ‚ú® Day 10: May 4, 2022. WED

### Today's Progress:
Studied the next few lessons on FreeCodeCamp (Do-while, JavaScript recursion)...

### Thoughts:
This was my first time hearing of the word recursion in JS, lol...but what it means is the process of a function calling itself. Consequently, the function must have a condition to stop calling itself, otherwise, the function is called indefinitely.<br/> Did a few do-while exercises as well (quite rudimentary)...
