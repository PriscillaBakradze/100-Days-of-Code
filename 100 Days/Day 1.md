## Day 1: April 25, 2022. MON
### Today's Progress: 
* Grateful to have the opportunity of buying online courses on Udemy. I started watching and following along with The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! [JavaScript Course 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/lecture/22628657#overview). 
So far it's easy and I'm breezing through the vidoes. :) 

* I watched a coding challenge on YouTube that covers 10 JS Projects and replicated a Countdown Timer website. [Coding Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4&ab_channel=FlorinPop).
