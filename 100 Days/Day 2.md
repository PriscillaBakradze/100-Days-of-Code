* I replicated a Quiz App website. [Coding Challenge](./https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4).

### Thoughts:

I just got familiar with ternary in JS ðŸ¥², and it is quite a useful conditional operator. The Internet really is, above all else, a repository of knowledge - all the information is on there, it's all about how I use these opportunities that will truly make a difference.
